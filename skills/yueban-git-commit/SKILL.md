# Git Commit with Conventional Commits

## Overview

Create standardized, semantic git commits based on Conventional Commits. Determine the appropriate type, scope, and message by analyzing the actual diff.

## Commit format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit language convention

1. Write `description` and `body` in English by default, unless the user explicitly asks for Chinese.
2. Keep `type`, `scope`, and convention keywords (e.g. `BREAKING CHANGE`, `Refs`, `Closes`) in their standard English form.
3. Leave proper nouns, code identifiers, paths, and commands as-is — do not force-translate them.

## Commit types

| Type       | Purpose                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                       |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                           |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                |
| `style`    | Formatting/style change (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Refactor (not a new feature, not a fix) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement           |
| `test`     | Add/update tests                  |
| `build`    | Build system/dependency changes   |
| `ci`       | CI/config changes                 |
| `chore`    | Maintenance/misc changes          |
| `revert`   | Revert a commit                   |

## Breaking changes

```
# Add an exclamation mark after type/scope
feat!: remove deprecated endpoint

# Use a BREAKING CHANGE footer
feat: support config inheritance from other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` field behavior has changed
```

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze the diff

```bash
# If files are already staged, check the staged diff
git diff --staged

# If nothing is staged, check the working tree diff
git diff

# Also check status
git status --porcelain
```

### 2. Stage files (if needed)

When nothing is staged yet, or you want to reorganize the change groupings:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# Stage by pattern
git add *.test.*
git add src/components/*

# Stage all tracked/untracked changes at once (use with caution)
git add -A
```

**Never commit sensitive information** (e.g. `.env`, `credentials.json`, private keys).

### 3. Generate the commit message

Analyze the diff and determine:

- **Type**: What category of change is this?
- **Scope**: Which module/area is affected?
- **Description**: A one-line description of the change (present tense, imperative mood, < 72 chars)

### 4. Perform the commit

```bash
# Confirm the staging area isn't empty before committing
if git diff --cached --quiet; then
  echo "Nothing staged — run git add first"
  exit 1
fi

# Single-line commit message
git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>"

# Multi-line commit message (with body/footer)
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>[scope]: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
EOF
)"
```

### 5. Push to the remote

Pushing is a side-effecting action visible to others — confirm with the user before doing it, the same way `yueban-git-safe-sync`/`yueban-git-feature-branch-flow` require confirmation before their own push steps. Skip asking only when the user's own request already implied it (e.g. "commit and push this", "commit, then push to origin"). After the commit succeeds (and, unless already implied, after the user confirms), push:

```bash
git push
# If there's no upstream, use: git push -u origin HEAD
```

## Handling submodules

If the repository tracks git submodules (see `.gitmodules`), they can show up in the parent repo's `git status`/`git diff` in two different ways — always tell them apart before staging:

1. **The submodule itself has uncommitted changes (dirty submodule)** — `git submodule status` prefixes the entry with `+`, and `git status` reports "modified content" or "untracked content". This means the submodule's own working tree has changes that were never committed inside the submodule.
   - Do not `git add <submodule-path>` directly in the parent repo — this silently rewinds the pointer to the submodule's previous commit, making the change appear to disappear while it actually still sits, uncommitted, inside the submodule.
   - `cd` into the submodule first and commit (and push) there, following the same Conventional Commits workflow, within the submodule's own history/conventions.
   - Only after the submodule's commit has been pushed to its own remote should you go back to the parent repo and stage the pointer change.

2. **Only the pointer moved (submodule HEAD changed, working tree clean)** — someone already committed and pushed inside the submodule (or it was updated via `git submodule update --remote`), and the parent repo just needs to record the new commit SHA.
   - Confirm the submodule's new commit has actually been pushed to its own remote (`git -C <submodule-path> status` shows "up to date"/no unpushed commits) — never point the pointer at a SHA that doesn't exist on the submodule's remote, or others will fail to fetch it after cloning.
   - Use `git diff --submodule=log -- <submodule-path>` (or a plain `git diff` if `diff.submodule=log` isn't configured) to see which commits are involved, and mention them in the commit body if the range is non-trivial.
   - Stage and commit the pointer bump as its own logical change, separate from unrelated file changes: `git add <submodule-path>`.
   - Use a message like `chore: bump <name> submodule` for a single submodule, or `chore: bump <name1>/<name2> submodules` when bumping several at once; add a short parenthetical reason if useful. If the pointer bump is incidental to a larger docs/feature change, it's fine to fold it into that commit's message instead of forcing a separate commit — follow whatever pattern the repo's history already uses.

When a submodule is in the "dirty" state from case 1, avoid `git add -A`/`git add .` — that would stage the pointer while the underlying commit doesn't exist anywhere durable. Stage the submodule path explicitly instead.

## Best practices

- Each commit should contain exactly one logical change
- Write in English by default: `add log aggregation script`, not a mixed-language description
- Use present tense, imperative mood: `fix parsing crash`, not `fixed parsing crash`
- Link issues: `Closes #123`, `Refs #456`
- Keep the description under 72 characters

## Git safety protocol

- Never modify git global/local config
- Never run destructive commands (e.g. `--force`, hard reset) without explicit request
- Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user asks for it
- Never force-push to `master`/`develop`
- If a commit fails due to hooks, fix the issue first and create a new commit (don't amend)
